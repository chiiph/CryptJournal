CryptJournal

This is a really simple encrypted notepad to dump those thoughts you don't want anybody else to hear :).
The only details to take into account is the key generation, which follows the standard operation PBKDF2, also it encrypts the entries with AES CBC 256 and saves them in plain text (QSettings form), and depends on PySide.
It's not really fast for several reasons, but fast enough for me at least.
